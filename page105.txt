But Hey, what if …

Digital planning tools - If you only use digital planning tools such as JIRA and you have a hard time figuring out how to apply these ideas, well that’s life. Hopefully you didn’t pay for this book. If you did, still no refund though.
 
Dis-located team - If your team isn’t co-located, perhaps you can position a high resolution webcam in front of the wall or send daily pictures to the team members off-site. Or discuss to rearrange the teams so that each team is co-located.
 
We don’t have whiteboards - Try using magic flipcharts. Or, be a rebel and draw directly on your walls. That will probably speed up the requisition of as many whiteboards as you need.
 
We only have yellow Post-its - Every policy can be changed. Figure out whom to talk to and go and talk to that person. Or go out and buy more colors and reimburse the purchase. Someone once said “Better ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.”
