Daily Goals

The single most important question to answer during the Daily Stand-up is; what do we need to do today as a team to bring ourselves one step closer to our current goal?

During the Daily Stand-up, if we would define the answer to that question like an achievement we would be proud of – what would that look like? That becomes the team’s goal for that day. 

During the next Daily Stand-up we assess if we accomplished our goal. If we did, we put a happy cross on the note. Then we proceed to define a new goal for today. Always define a new Daily Goal. Don’t simply copy yesterday’s goal in the case we didn’t fulfill it. Everyday is a new day and there is always some circumstance that has changed.
