Concept Cubes

Instead of summarizing the results of a workshop on a poster, or having a working agreements’ area on your whiteboard – create a physical cube! One side could show the name of the cube and the others contain text and images. A cube invites to curiosity! I’ve seen people being far more eager to pick up a cube then to stop by and read a poster.

Examples of cubes:
Meetings. Each side describes the purpose and outcome of the different meetings (Daily Stand-up, Planning, Retrospective, etc), as well as the default meeting routine.
Working agreements (Definition of Done, Definition of Ready, Behavior of conduct, Way of working, etc.).
Expectations of roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Team member, Development manager, etc.).
