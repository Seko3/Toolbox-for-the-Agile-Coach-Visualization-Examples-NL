Rotating facilitatorâ€™s hat

Does the Scrum Master really need to be the facilitator of every Daily Stand-up? Of course not. Why not rotate the facilitation. 

Facilitating a good, short and concrete Daily Stand-up meeting is difficult. By rotating the facilitation you share the experience and more people get to practice facilitation skills. 

To emphasize the rotation of the facilitator, get a nice hat for the facilitator to wear.
