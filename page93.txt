Color the glass

Does your team have partial glass walls defining your team area, why not put them to use. Glass walls allow you to make really fancy and colorful Scrum or Kanban walls by putting up colored paper with adhesive tape on the other side of the glass.

You can use different colored papers to emphasize different lanes and areas. You could even use colors to signal status of your work or other important factors.
