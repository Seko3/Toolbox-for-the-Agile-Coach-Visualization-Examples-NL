General advice

Accessible – Position your wall with visualizations in the area where the team sits. You want it easily visible for everyone in the room.


Simple - The wall needs to be easy to update. If you make it too cumbersome to update, the wall will probably deteriorate. If you suspect that it’s not up to date, you will stop trusting it. If you don’t trust it, you will update it even less frequently.

Clean – If you put love and care into designing the wall you will probably respect it more and want to continue to keep it nice and tidy. Don’t go bananas, choose components with care.

Core flows – Design for the normal cases and core flows. Choose additional components based on the behaviors you want to change. Treat exceptions like exceptions.

Evaluate – Your wall is a living thing. Evaluate each component's value and design regularly. Improve, adjust or abandon.
